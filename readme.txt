Movie-Based Battleship.
======================

I'm not quite sure how extensive the idea should be, but for now i'll keep it to the basics.
The idea for movie based battleship is kind of a combination with a quiz aspect. The goal of the game is to guess all the movies correct. Instead of ships, each time you hit a target with a 'bomb' you'll get a famous movie quote in return. Instead of ships, we're playing with movies. So the size of the ship/film (1,2,3 or 4) is equal to amount of of quotes (hints) you can earn. 
Basicly, by this quotes, you need to guess the film. For instance when you drop the 'bomb' and hit a target, a pop up will tell you: "I see dead people". Some of us might know that's a quote from "The Sixth Sense" and conquer the ship right away, others might need to hit the ship another time and get the next quote: "Walking around like regular people. They don't see each other. They only see what they want to see. They don't kow they are dead", before they know the ship represents the Sixth Sense. 
Since there are loads of movies, there a loads of variations you can make. You could even do games by genre (like zombie-movies; westerns, horror, classics, etc)
Ofcourse the winner is the one to guess the most movies correctly:).
